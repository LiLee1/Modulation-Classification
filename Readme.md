# Modulation-Classification
Detecting the Modulation Scheme of Received Signal using AutoML Techniques.

## AutoML
- AutoML Procedure is used for Traning and Testing of Generated Data. AutoKeras are used for performing AutoML for deep learning models.

## Synthetic Datasets

### Data-Generation
- Data represents Constellation Received-Signal at the Receiver's End.
- Data is generated using Basic MatLab Commands.
- Transmitted Signal is modulated with QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM Modulation Schemes.
- Signal is passed through Rayleigh's Multi-Path Fading Channel and AWGN for various SNR ratios.
- For training, SNR = 30dB.
- For testing, SNR = 5dB, 10dB, 15dB, 20dB, 25dB.
- For Rayleigh Multi-Path Fading, ChannelLengths = [2,3] are considered. Channel Model is changed for each and every SNR Ratio.

### Visualisations
- Visualising generated Data.

### Training and Testing
- Training and Testing on Synthetic Datasets is complete and their Results and Models are saved in Syntheic Datasets folder.

## Real Datasets

This part of the project is still under development.
