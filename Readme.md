## Data-Generation
- Data represents Constellation Received-Signal at the Receiver's End.
- Data is generated using MatLab Communication ToolBox.
- Transmitted Signal is modulated with QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM Modulation Schemes.
- Signal is passed through Rayleigh's Multi-Path Fading Channel and AWGN for various SNR ratios.
- For training, SNR = 30dB.
- For testing, SNR = 5dB, 10dB, 15dB, 20dB, 25dB.
- For Rayleigh Multi-Path Fading, ChannelLengths = [2,3] are considered. Channel Model is changed for each and every SNR Ratio.

## Visualisations
- Visualising generated Data.

## AutoML
- AutoML Code for Traning and Testing Data from AWGN and Rayleigh Channels.
